# archdi

Just a simple bash script wizard to install and configure a full personal computer / gaming with Arch Linux.

First, install Arch Linux with the official media and optionally with archfi.<br />
Look at archfi project to start your arch linux installation : https://github.com/BrainlessDylan/Archfi_Plus

After reboot and your network ready, download the script :<br />
curl -L archdi.sf.net/archdi > archdi<br />
or if sourceforge is down :<br />
curl -L matmoul.github.io/archdi > archdi<br />

And run the script :<br />
sh archdi

Or you can install it on your system with<br />
sh archdi -i<br />
And then you can use archdi cmd.<br />
With this, you can make your updates or install your packages later.

This package is only a launcher for archdi-pkg.<br />
